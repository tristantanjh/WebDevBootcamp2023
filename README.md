### Projects

During the duration of this course, I have successfully completed numerous projects, both with the assistance of video lectures and independently. While there are numerous smaller projects that I have worked on, I will only highlight a few notable ones below.

#### Simon Game
The Simon game app is a digital adaptation of the classic memory game, Simon. It challenges players to remember and replicate a sequence of colors and sounds.

The core learning outcomes from creating this app include gaining proficiency in jQuery, improving JavaScript syntax, and understanding fundamental concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and game logic implementation. Through this project, I deepened my knowledge of front-end development and honed my skills in creating interactive and engaging web applications.
