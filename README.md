### Skills Learned

Through this course, I have had the opportunity to explore and learn various technologies, tools, and frameworks that have been instrumental in my journey towards becoming a full-stack web developer. 
Some of the key areas I've delved into include:

1. **Front-end Development**: The course provided a comprehensive understanding of front-end technologies such as **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I gained proficiency in building interactive and responsive user interfaces that enhance the overall user experience.

2. **JavaScript Frameworks**: I had the chance to work with popular JavaScript frameworks like **React.js**, enabling me to create dynamic and robust web applications. These frameworks provided me with powerful tools to handle state management, component-based architecture, and efficient rendering.

3. **Back-end Development**: The course equipped me with the skills to develop server-side applications using frameworks like **Node.js and Express.js**. I learned about routing, middleware, and handling server-side logic, allowing me to build scalable and efficient back-end systems.

4. **Databases**: Understanding how to work with databases is crucial for full-stack development. The course introduced me to both SQL and NoSQL databases like **MySQL and MongoDB**. I gained insights into data modeling, querying, and performing CRUD operations, enabling me to store and retrieve information efficiently.

5. **Version Control and Collaboration**: I learned the importance of using version control systems like **Git**, which allowed me to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage project history effectively. I also became familiar with platforms like **GitHub**, where I could host my repositories and collaborate with other developers.

6. **Deployment and Hosting**: The course covered the process of deploying web applications, using platforms like **Heroku**. I learned about configuring servers, setting up environments, and ensuring proper deployment of both front-end and back-end components.

7. **Web3 Development and Smart Contracts**: This course provided me with an introduction to Web3 development using **Motoko**, a programming language for building decentralized applications on the Internet Computer. I learned how to create smart contracts and deploy them on blockchain networks. This knowledge opened up possibilities for me to explore the world of blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized applications (dApps), allowing me to contribute to the growing ecosystem of Web3 technologies.

### Projects

During the duration of this course, I have successfully completed numerous projects, both with the assistance of video lectures and independently. While there are numerous smaller projects that I have worked on, I will only highlight a few notable ones below.

#### Keeper App
This note-taking app is specifically developed for practicing React.js and focuses solely on the front-end implementation. As the backend functionality is not integrated, data cannot be saved beyond a single session. 
Working on this project allowed me to gain valuable insights into React.js and become familiar with Material UI, a React component library. <br /> <br />
**Note:** I am currently in the process of integrating this app with a database to transform it into a fully-fledged project.

#### Wiki API
This project is a RESTful API built with Express.js and MongoDB, providing users with access to routes for making API calls to a database resembling Wikipedia. It enables various operations, including retrieving articles, creating new ones, updating existing articles, and deleting articles.

Through working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs using Express.js and integrating them with a MongoDB database. I learned how to create and handle routes, implement CRUD operations, and ensure data persistence. This project deepened my understanding of backend development, API design principles, and working with databases.
