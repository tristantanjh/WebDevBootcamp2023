3. **Back-end Development**: The course equipped me with the skills to develop server-side applications using frameworks like <img height=20px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/183568594-85e280a7-0d7e-4d1a-9028-c8c2209e073c.png"> **Node.js and <img height=20px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/183859966-a3462d8d-1bc7-4880-b353-e2cbed900ed6.png"> Express.js**. I learned about routing, middleware, and handling server-side logic, allowing me to build scalable and efficient back-end systems.

4. **Databases**: Understanding how to work with databases is crucial for full-stack development. The course introduced me to both SQL and NoSQL databases like **<img height=20px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/183896128-ec99105a-ec1a-4d85-b08b-1aa1620b2046.png"> MySQL and <img height=20px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/182884177-d48a8579-2cd0-447a-b9a6-ffc7cb02560e.png"> MongoDB**. I gained insights into data modeling, querying, and performing CRUD operations, enabling me to store and retrieve information efficiently.

5. **Authentication and Security**: In this course, I gained valuable knowledge about concepts such as hashing and encryption. 
I also learned to implement third-party authentication, such as Google Sign-In, enabling users to authenticate using their Google accounts, through packages like <img height=20px src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1chwCCIynsV5RBBqopV0dcCd5Hrr8OOdJ"> **passport**. This knowledge greatly enhanced my understanding of safeguarding user accounts and reinforcing the overall security of web applications.

6. **Version Control and Collaboration**: I learned the importance of using version control systems like <img height=20px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/192108372-f71d70ac-7ae6-4c0d-8395-51d8870c2ef0.png"> **Git**, which allowed me to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage project history effectively. I also became familiar with platforms like <img height=20px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/192108374-8da61ba1-99ec-41d7-80b8-fb2f7c0a4948.png"> **GitHub**, where I could host my repositories and collaborate with other developers.

7. **Deployment and Hosting**: The course covered the process of deploying web applications, using platforms like <img height=20px src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13bHHHELckI5LdLreUikZ6gwhSjvTD4n6"> **Heroku**. I learned about configuring servers, setting up environments, and ensuring proper deployment of both front-end and back-end components.

8. **Web3 Development and Smart Contracts**: This course provided me with an introduction to Web3 development using <img height=20px src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-3nJm3VWq0r2_ao4Zsg2IpKORwpWUBZD"> **Motoko**, a programming language for building decentralized applications on the <img height=20px src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12c2q2w6-EXkcrNpPVeqzYX2kTT7wmslL"> **Internet Computer**. I learned how to create smart contracts and deploy them on blockchain networks. This knowledge opened up possibilities for me to explore the world of blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized applications (dApps), allowing me to contribute to the growing ecosystem of Web3 technologies.

### Projects

During the duration of this course, I have successfully completed numerous projects, both with the assistance of video lectures and independently. While there are numerous smaller projects that I have worked on, I will only highlight a few notable ones below.

#### Keeper App
This note-taking app is specifically developed for practicing React.js and focuses solely on the front-end implementation. As the backend functionality is not integrated, data cannot be saved beyond a single session. 
Working on this project allowed me to gain valuable insights into React.js and become familiar with Material UI, a React component library. <br /> <br />
**Note:** I am currently in the process of integrating this app with a database to transform it into a fully-fledged project.

Check out the application [here](https://tristantanjh.github.io/KeeperApp/).    
Source code and full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/tristantanjh/KeeperApp).   

#### Wiki API
This project is a RESTful API built with Express.js and MongoDB, providing users with access to routes for making API calls to a database resembling Wikipedia. It enables various operations, including retrieving articles, creating new ones, updating existing articles, and deleting articles.

Through working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs using Express.js and integrating them with a MongoDB database. I learned how to create and handle routes, implement CRUD operations, and ensure data persistence. This project deepened my understanding of backend development, API design principles, and working with databases.
